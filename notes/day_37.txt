50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-37

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve the patient_id, first_name, and last_name from the patients table for those individuals whose patient_id does not exist in any rows of the admissions table

üí°Solution 

SELECT patient_id, first_name, last_name FROM patients WHERE patient_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT patient_id FROM admissions)

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT patient_id, first_name, last_name: Selects the patient_id, first_name, and last_name from the "patients" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM patients: Specifies the "patients" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é WHERE patient_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT patient_id FROM admissions): Filters the results to include only rows where the patient_id does not exist in any rows of the "admissions" table. The subquery (SELECT DISTINCT patient_id FROM admissions) returns a list of patient_ids from the "admissions" table, and NOT IN ensures that only patients who have never been admitted are selected

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
