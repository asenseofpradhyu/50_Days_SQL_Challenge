50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-25

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Identify tracks in the "Track" table that have never been purchased.

üí°Solution 

SELECT track_tbl.name FROM 'Track' track_tbl LEFT JOIN InvoiceLine invoiceline_tbl ON  track_tbl.TrackId = invoiceline_tbl.TrackId WHERE invoiceline_tbl.TrackId IS NULL

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT track_tbl.name

This selects the track name from the Track table and gives it an alias Name.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Track'

This part of the query specifies the main table as Track and gives it the alias albums.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è LEFT JOIN InvoiceLine invoiceline_tbl ON  track_tbl.TrackId = invoiceline_tbl.TrackId 

Performs a left join between InvoiceLine and Track tables based on the TrackId column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE invoiceline_tbl.TrackId IS NULL

Filters the results to include only rows where there is no matching record in the InvoiceLine table. This condition ensures that you are selecting albums that have missing tracksID.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
