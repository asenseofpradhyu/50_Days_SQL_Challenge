50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-41

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

For each day display the total amount of admissions on that day. Display the amount changed from the previous date.

üí°Solution 

SELECT admission_date, COUNT(admission_date) AS admission_day, COUNT(admission_date) - LAG(COUNT(admission_date)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS admission_count_change FROM admissions GROUP BY admission_date ORDER BY admission_date

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é admission_date: Represents the column containing admission dates.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é COUNT(admission_date) AS admission_day: Uses the COUNT() aggregate function to calculate the total number of admissions for each day.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é LAG(COUNT(admission_date)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS admission_count_change: Applies the LAG() window function to the result of the COUNT() function, helping in calculating the difference in the number of admissions from the previous day.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM admissions: Specifies the "admissions" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY admission_date: Groups the results by the "admission_date" column to compute the total number of admissions for each day.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY admission_date: Orders the result set by "admission_date" to present the data in chronological order.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
