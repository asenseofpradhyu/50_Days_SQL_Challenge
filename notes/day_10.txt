50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-10

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve all the even-numbered Order_id from the orders table.

üí°Solution 

SELECT Order_id FROM 'orders' WHERE MOD(Order_id, 2) = 0

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT Order_id

This SQL query selects Order_id and retrive Even numbered Order_id.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'orders'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "orders".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE MOD(Order_id, 2) = 0

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves even numbered Order_id records.

WHERE:- In our query, the condition is 'MOD(Order_id, 2) = 0,' which means it must return the Order_id where the remainder is equal to zero.

MOD:- MOD is used to find the reminder of a division operation. It is particularly useful when dealing with mathematical operations and conditional logic.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
