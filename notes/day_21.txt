50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-21

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write an SQL query that counts the number of customers from each country. You should group the results by Country and order them alphabetically by Country.

💡Solution 

SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as CustomerCount FROM 'Customer' GROUP BY Country

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as CustomerCount

This part of the query selects the 'Country' column and counts the number of customers for each country. The result is given an alias 'CustomerCount' for clarity.

▶️ FROM 'Customer'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Customer".

▶️ GROUP BY Country

GROUP BY:- Groups the results by the 'Country' column, so the count is aggregated for each unique Country.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
