50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-26

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Calculate the total sales for each month from the Invoice table.

üí°Solution 


SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month, SUM(Total) AS TotalSale FROM Invoice GROUP BY Month ORDER BY Month;

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month, SUM(Total) AS TotalSale

This formats the "InvoiceDate" column into 'YYYY-MM' format using the strftime function and aliases it as "Month". This calculates the total sales for each month by summing up the "Total" column and aliases it as "TotalSales".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Invoice'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Invoice".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è GROUP BY Month ORDER BY Month

Groups the results by the formatted "Month" column. Orders the result set by the "Month" column in ascending order.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
