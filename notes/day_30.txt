50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-30

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Your task is to determine the number of line items associated with each invoice.

üí°Solution 

SELECT Invoice.InvoiceId, COUNT(InvoiceLine.InvoiceLineId) AS LineCount FROM Invoice JOIN InvoiceLine ON Invoice.InvoiceId = InvoiceLine.InvoiceId GROUP BY Invoice.InvoiceId ORDER BY Invoice.InvoiceId

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Invoice.InvoiceId: Selects the "InvoiceId" from the "Invoice" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é COUNT(InvoiceLine.InvoiceLineId) AS LineCount: Counts the number of line items for each invoice by counting the "InvoiceLineId" in the "InvoiceLine" table. The result is aliased as "LineCount."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Invoice: Specifies the "Invoice" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é JOIN InvoiceLine ON Invoice.InvoiceId = InvoiceLine.InvoiceId: Performs a join between the "Invoice" and "InvoiceLine" tables based on the common "InvoiceId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY Invoice.InvoiceId: Groups the results by "InvoiceId" to count the number of line items for each invoice.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Invoice.InvoiceId: Orders the result set by "InvoiceId."

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
