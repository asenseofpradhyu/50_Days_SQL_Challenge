50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-11

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve track names and their corresponding album IDs for tracks that have a duration longer than 5 minutes.

💡Solution 

SELECT Name,AlbumId FROM 'track' WHERE Milliseconds > 300000 ORDER BY Name ASC

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT Name,AlbumId

This SQL query selects Name, and AlbumId

▶️ FROM 'track'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "track".

▶️ WHERE Milliseconds > 300000 ORDER BY Name

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieve track names and their corresponding album IDs for tracks that have a duration longer than 5 minutes.

WHERE:- In our query, the condition is 'Milliseconds > 300000 ORDER BY Name' which means it must return It restricts the result set to only include rows where the 'Milliseconds' column has a value greater than 300,000(Which is 5 minutes).

ORDER BY:- Use this to sort the records in ascending or descending order. You can use 'ASC' for Ascending order and 'DESC' for Descending order.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
