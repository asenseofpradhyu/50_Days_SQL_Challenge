50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-12

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show the average unit price rounded to 2 decimal places, the total units in stock, and the total discontinued products from the products table.

üí°Solution 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(unit_price),2) as average_price, sum(units_in_stock) as total_stock, SUM(discontinued) as total_discontinued  FROM 'products'

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT ROUND(AVG(unit_price),2) as average_price, sum(units_in_stock) as total_stock, SUM(discontinued) as total_discontinued

This SQL query retrieve the following results:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(unit_price), 2) AS average_price: This part of the query calculates the average unit price for all products in the 'products' table. The ROUND function is used to round the result to two decimal places.

SUM(units_in_stock) AS total_stock: This part calculates the total sum of units in stock for all products in the 'products' table.

SUM(discontinued) AS total_discontinued: This part calculates the total sum of discontinued products in the 'products' table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'products'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "products".
