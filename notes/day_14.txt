50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-14

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write an SQL query to display the number of duplicate patients based on their first_name and last_name.

💡Solution 

SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) as num_of_duplicates FROM patients GROUP BY first_name, last_name HAVING num_of_duplicates > 1;

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) as num_of_duplicates 

This part tells the database to select the columns 'first_name' and 'last_name' from the 'patients' table. It also uses the COUNT(*) function to count the number of occurrences for each unique combination of first name and last name. The result of this count is given an alias 'num_of_duplicates' for clarity.

▶️ FROM 'patients'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

▶️ GROUP BY first_name, last_name HAVING num_of_duplicates > 1

GROUP BY:- This groups the rows in the table based on unique combinations of first name and last name.

HAVING num_of_duplicates > 1:- It selects only those first and last name combinations where there are multiple patients sharing the same names.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
