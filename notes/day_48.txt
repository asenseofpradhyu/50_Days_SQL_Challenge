50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-48

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve the latest invoice date for each customer

üí°Solution 

SELECT  t.GenreId,  t.Name AS MaxDurationTrackName FROM  Track t INNER JOIN  (SELECT GenreId, MAX(Milliseconds) AS MaxDuration FROM Track GROUP BY  GenreId) AS MaxDurationPerGenre ON t.GenreId = MaxDurationPerGenre.GenreId AND t.Milliseconds = MaxDurationPerGenre.MaxDuration ORDER BY t.GenreId

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Clause: t.GenreId: Selects the GenreId from the "Track" table. t.Name AS MaxDurationTrackName: Selects the track name and aliases it as "MaxDurationTrackName"

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Clause: "Track" t: Specifies the "Track" table and aliases it as "t"

‚ñ∂Ô∏é INNER JOIN Clause: MaxDurationPerGenre: This is a subquery that calculates the maximum duration for each genre. It is aliased as "MaxDurationPerGenre". ON t.GenreId = MaxDurationPerGenre.GenreId AND t.Milliseconds = MaxDurationPerGenre.MaxDuration: Specifies the join condition, linking tracks to their corresponding maximum duration for each genre.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Clause: ORDER BY t.GenreId: Orders the result set by GenreId

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
