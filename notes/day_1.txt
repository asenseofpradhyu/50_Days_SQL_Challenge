50 days SQL Challenge

Day-1

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

1. Retrieve the first_name and last_name of patients.
2. The query should only select patients whose weight is within the range of 100 to 120 (inclusive).

üí°Solution 

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients WHERE weight BETWEEN 100 AND 120

üìù Explanation

Here, the challenge is to extract the first and last names of patients with a weight within the range of 100 to 120.

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT first_name, last_name

This part of the SQL query specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the "patients" table. Therefore, this query will return a list of "first_name" and "last_name" columns based on certain criteria.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM patients

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE weight BETWEEN 100 AND 120

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: it retrieves data where the "weight" column falls within the range of 100 to 120.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'weight BETWEEN 100 AND 120'.

BETWEEN:- This is used to define range condition and its followed by two values separated by "AND" keyword.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
