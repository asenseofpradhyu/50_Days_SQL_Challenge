50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-15

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

write an SQL query to find patients who have been admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis. You are required to display the patient_id and diagnosis for these cases.

💡Solution 

SELECT patient_id, diagnosis FROM 'admissions' GROUP BY patient_id,diagnosis HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT patient_id, diagnosis 

This part tells the database to select the columns 'patient_id' and 'diagnosis' from the 'admissions' table.

▶️ FROM 'admissions'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "admissions".

▶️ GROUP BY patient_id,diagnosis HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 

GROUP BY:- This groups the rows in the table based on unique combinations of 'patient_id' and 'diagnosis'

HAVING COUNT(*) > 1:- Filters the grouped results to include only those groups where the count of occurrences is greater than 1, meaning there are duplicates.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
