50 days SQL Challenge

Day-6

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write an SQL query to show the patient id and the total number of admissions for a patient with a patient_id of 579. Your query should return the patient_id and the total count of admissions for that patient with the column name alias total_admissions


💡Solution 

SELECT patient_id, COUNT(admission_date) as total_admissions FROM 'admissions' WHERE patient_id = 579

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT patient_id, COUNT(admission_date) as total_admissions

This part of the SQL query will return patient_id and total number of admission_date as a total_admissions column from 'admissions' table.

COUNT() is an aggregate function that is used to count the number of rows in a result set. Here, we are counting specific column admission_date in admissions table.


▶️ FROM admissions

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "admissions".

▶️ WHERE patient_id = 579

This part of the SQL query filters records based on patient ID 579.
