50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-19

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of unique cities where patients in the patients table reside. The catch is, you only need to list cities that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), and sort them in ascending order.

üí°Solution 

SELECT DISTINCT city FROM 'patients' WHERE city LIKE 'a%' OR city LIKE 'e%' OR city LIKE 'i%' OR city LIKE 'o%' OR city LIKE 'u%' ORDER BY city asc

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT DISTINCT city

This SQL query selects all unique values in the "City" column from the "Customer" table. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each city name appears only once in the result set.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'patients'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE city LIKE 'a%' OR city LIKE 'e%' OR city LIKE 'i%' OR city LIKE 'o%' OR city LIKE 'u%' ORDER BY city asc

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'city LIKE 'a%' OR city LIKE 'e%' OR city LIKE 'i%' OR city LIKE 'o%' OR city LIKE 'u%' ORDER BY city asc'.

ORDER BY:- This part of the query orders the result set based on the 'city' column in ascending order (from the smallest to the largest).

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
