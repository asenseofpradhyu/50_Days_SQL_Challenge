50 days SQL Challenge

Day-4

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve the first_name, last_name, and height of the patient with the greatest height.


üí°Solution 

SELECT first_name, last_name, MAX(height) AS height FROM patients

üìù Explanation

Here, The challenge is to retrieve the first name, last name, and height of the patient with the greatest height among the patients.

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT first_name, last_name, MAX(height) as height

This part of the SQL query specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the "patients" table. Therefore, this query will return a single row with first name, last name and height of whose patient has max height in the table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è MAX(height) AS height

Aggregate function in sql are functions that perform a calculate on a set of values and returns a single value and the 'AS' keyword is used to give a column alias, providing a temporary name to a column or a table in the result set.

here are the other aggregate functions
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a result set.
SUM(): Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
AVG(): Calculates the average of values in a numeric column.
MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.
MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM patients

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".


Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
