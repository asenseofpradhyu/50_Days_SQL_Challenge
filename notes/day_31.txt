50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-31

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Determine the number of albums associated with each artist in the database

üí°Solution 

SELECT Artist.Name AS Name, COUNT(Album.AlbumId) AS AlbumCount FROM Artist LEFT JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId GROUP BY Artist.ArtistId, Artist.Name ORDER BY Artist.ArtistId

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Artist.Name AS ArtistName: Selects the name of the artist from the "Artist" table and aliases it as "Name."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é COUNT(Album.AlbumId) AS AlbumCount: Counts the number of albums for each artist by counting the "AlbumId" in the "Album" table. The result is aliased as "AlbumCount."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Artist: Specifies the "Artist" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é LEFT JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId: Performs a left join between the "Artist" and "Album" tables based on the common "ArtistId" column. This ensures that artists with zero albums are also included in the result.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY Artist.ArtistId, Artist.Name: Groups the results by "ArtistId" and "Name" to count the number of albums for each artist.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Artist.ArtistId: Orders the result set by "ArtistId."

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
