50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-20

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write a SQL query that returns the name of each city and the total number of patients residing in that city with the column name as num_patients. Your query should order the results first by the total number of patients (num_patients) in descending order, and then by the city name in ascending alphabetical order.

üí°Solution 

SELECT city, COUNT(patient_id) AS num_patients FROM patients GROUP BY city ORDER BY num_patients DESC, city ASC;

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT city, COUNT(patient_id) AS num_patients

This part of the query selects the 'city' column and counts the number of patients for each city. The result is given an alias 'num_patients' for clarity.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'patients'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è GROUP BY city ORDER BY num_patients DESC, city ASC;

GROUP BY:- Groups the results by the 'city' column, so the count is aggregated for each unique city.

ORDER BY:- Orders the result set first by the total number of patients (num_patients) in descending order (DESC), and then by the city name in ascending alphabetical order (ASC).

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
