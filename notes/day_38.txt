50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-38

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show first_name, last_name, and the total number of admissions attended for each doctor. Every admission has been attended by a doctor.

üí°Solution 

SELECT doctors.first_name, doctors.last_name, COUNT(admissions.patient_id) AS admissions_total FROM doctors JOIN admissions ON doctors.doctor_id = admissions.attending_doctor_id GROUP BY doctors.doctor_id, doctors.first_name, doctors.last_name

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT doctors.first_name, doctors.last_name: Selects the first_name and last_name from the "doctors" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é COUNT(admissions.admission_id) AS admissions_total: Counts the total number of admissions for each doctor using the COUNT() aggregate function. The result is aliased as "admissions_total."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM doctors: Specifies the "doctors" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é JOIN admissions ON doctors.doctor_id = admissions.doctor_id: Performs a join between the "doctors" and "admissions" tables based on the common "doctor_id" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY doctors.doctor_id, doctors.first_name, doctors.last_name: Groups the results by "doctor_id," "first_name," and "last_name" to calculate the total number of admissions for each doctor

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
