50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-43

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Sort the province names in ascending order in such a way that the province 'Ontario' is always on top

💡Solution 

SELECT pn.province_name FROM province_names pn JOIN patients p ON pn.province_id = p.province_id GROUP BY pn.province_name HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'M' THEN 1 END) > COUNT(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END)

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶︎ SELECT Clause: pn.province_name: Selects the column representing the province names from the "province_names" table.

▶︎ FROM Clause: province_names pn: Specifies the "province_names" table and assigns the alias "pn" for brevity. patients p ON pn.province_id = p.province_id: Performs a join with the "patients" table based on the common "province_id" column.

▶︎ GROUP BY Clause: GROUP BY pn.province_name: Groups the result set by the province_name column. This is necessary because we are using aggregate functions in the HAVING clause.

▶︎ HAVING Clause: HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'M' THEN 1 END) > COUNT(CASE WHEN p.gender = 'F' THEN 1 END): Filters the grouped results based on the condition that the count of male patients is greater than the count of female patients.

This condition is applied using the COUNT function along with the CASE statement. It counts the occurrences of 'M' and 'F' based on the gender column for each province group
