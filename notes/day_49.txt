50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-49

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Your task is to pivot the "Title" column from the Employee table and count the number of occurrences of each unique title.

üí°Solution 

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN Title = 'Sales Support Agent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SalesAgentCount, SUM(CASE WHEN Title = 'Support Representative' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SupportAgentCount, SUM(CASE WHEN Title NOT IN ('Sales Support Agent', 'Support Representative') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS OtherTitleCount FROM Employee ORDER BY SalesAgentCount

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Clause:

SUM(CASE WHEN Title = 'Sales Support Agent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SalesAgentCount: Calculates the count of employees with the title 'Sales Support Agent'.

SUM(CASE WHEN Title = 'Support Representative' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SupportAgentCount: Calculates the count of employees with the title 'Support Representative'.

SUM(CASE WHEN Title NOT IN ('Sales Support Agent', 'Support Representative') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS OtherTitleCount: Calculates the count of employees with titles other than 'Sales Support Agent' and 'Support Representative'.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Clause: Employee: Specifies the "Employee" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Clause: ORDER BY SalesAgentCount: Orders the result set by the count of employees with the title 'Sales Support Agent'.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
