50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-44

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show first name, last name and role of every person that is either patient or doctor. The roles are either "Patient" or "Doctor". Make sure to name this column as "role"

üí°Solution 

SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Patient' AS role FROM patients UNION ALL SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Doctor' AS role FROM doctors

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Patient' AS role: Retrieves the first_name and last_name columns from the patients table. The literal string 'Patient' is assigned as the role for each person in the patients table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é UNION ALL: Combines the results of the two SELECT statements. Unlike the regular UNION operator, UNION ALL includes all rows, even if there are duplicates. In this context, it's suitable because a person might be both a patient and a doctor.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Doctor' AS role: Retrieves the first_name and last_name columns from the doctors table. The literal string 'Doctor' is assigned as the role for each person in the doctors table.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
