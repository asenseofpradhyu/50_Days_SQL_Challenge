50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-28

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Your task is to write a SQL query to identify tracks that appear under more than one genre

💡Solution 

SELECT Track.Name, COUNT(DISTINCT Genre.GenreId) AS GenreCount FROM Track JOIN Genre ON Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId GROUP BY Track.TrackId HAVING GenreCount > 1 ORDER BY Track.TrackId

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT Track.Name, COUNT(DISTINCT Genre.GenreId) AS GenreCount

Selects the name of the tracks from the "Track" table. Counts the number of distinct genres associated with each track and aliases the result as "GenreCount".

▶️ FROM 'Track'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Track".

▶️ JOIN Genre ON Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId

Performs an inner join between the "Track" and "Genre" tables based on the common "GenreId" column.

▶️ GROUP BY Track.TrackId

Groups the results by track to count the number of genres associated with each track.

▶️ HAVING GenreCount > 1 ORDER BY Track.TrackId

Filters the results to include only tracks with more than one associated genre and orders the result set by the TrackId

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
