50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-47

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve the latest invoice date for each customer

üí°Solution 

SELECT "Customer"."CustomerId", MAX("Invoice"."InvoiceDate") AS "MaxInvoiceDate" FROM "Customer" JOIN "Invoice" ON "Customer"."CustomerId" = "Invoice"."CustomerId" GROUP BY "Customer"."CustomerId" ORDER BY "Customer"."CustomerId" ASC

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Clause: "Customer"."CustomerId": Selects the unique identifier of the customer. MAX("Invoice"."InvoiceDate") AS "MaxInvoiceDate": Calculates the maximum (latest) invoice date for each customer using the MAX() aggregate function. This value is aliased as "MaxInvoiceDate".

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Clause: "Customer": Specifies the "Customer" table. "Invoice" ON "Customer"."CustomerId" = "Invoice"."CustomerId": Performs an INNER JOIN between the "Customer" and "Invoice" tables based on the common "CustomerId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY Clause: "Customer"."CustomerId": Groups the results by customer, ensuring that the MAX() function is applied to each customer's set of invoices.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Clause: "Customer"."CustomerId" ASC: Orders the result set by CustomerId in ascending order.
