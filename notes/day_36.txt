50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-36

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Calculate the total duration of each playlist in milliseconds

üí°Solution 

SELECT Playlist.Name AS Name, SUM(Track.Milliseconds) AS TotalDuration FROM Playlist JOIN PlaylistTrack ON Playlist.PlaylistId = PlaylistTrack.PlaylistI JOIN Track ON PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId GROUP BY Playlist.PlaylistId, Playlist.Name ORDER BY Playlist.PlaylistId

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Playlist.Name AS Name: Selects the name of the playlist from the "Playlist" table and aliases it as "Name."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SUM(Track.Milliseconds) AS TotalDuration: Calculates the total duration for each playlist by summing up the "Milliseconds" column from the "Track" table. The result is aliased as "TotalDuration."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Playlist: Specifies the "Playlist" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é JOIN PlaylistTrack ON Playlist.PlaylistId = PlaylistTrack.PlaylistId: Performs a join between the "Playlist" and "PlaylistTrack" tables based on the common "PlaylistId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é JOIN Track ON PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId: Performs another join with the "Track" table based on the common "TrackId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY Playlist.PlaylistId, Playlist.Name: Groups the results by "PlaylistId" and "Name" to calculate the total duration for each playlist.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Playlist.PlaylistId: Orders the result set by "PlaylistId."

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
