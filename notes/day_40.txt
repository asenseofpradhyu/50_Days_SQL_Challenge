50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-40

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Your task is to calculate the total cost of admissions for patients based on their insurance status

üí°Solution 

SELECT CASE WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_insurance, SUM(CASE WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 10 ELSE 50 END) AS cost_after_insurance FROM admissions GROUP BY has_insurance

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é CASE WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_insurance: Uses the CASE statement to label each patient with 'Yes' if they have insurance (even patient_id) and 'No' if they don't.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SUM(CASE WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 10 ELSE 50 END) AS total_admission_cost: Uses another CASE statement within the SUM function to calculate the total admission cost for each group. For patients with insurance ('Yes'), the cost is $10, and for patients without insurance ('No'), the cost is $50.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM admissions: Specifies the "admissions" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é GROUP BY has_insurance: Groups the results by the 'has_insurance' column to calculate the total admission cost for each group

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
