50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-27

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write an SQL query to list the top 5 customers who have the highest number of invoices. Your output should show the first names of these customers alongside the count of their invoices.

üí°Solution 

SELECT Customer.FirstName, COUNT(Invoice.InvoiceId) AS InvoiceCount FROM Customer JOIN Invoice ON Customer.CustomerId = Invoice.CustomerId GROUP BY Customer.CustomerId ORDER BY InvoiceCount DESC LIMIT 5;

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT Customer.FirstName, COUNT(Invoice.InvoiceId) AS InvoiceCount

This formats the "InvoiceDate" column into 'YYYY-MM' format using the strftime function and aliases it as "Month". This calculates the total sales for each month by summing up the "Total" column and aliases it as "TotalSales".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Customer'

This part of the query specifies the main table as Customer.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è JOIN Invoice ON Customer.CustomerId = Invoice.CustomerId

Performs an inner join between "Customer" and "Invoice" tables based on the common "CustomerId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è GROUP BY Customer.CustomerId ORDER BY InvoiceCount DESC

Groups the results by customer to count the number of invoices for each customer. Orders the results by the "InvoiceCount" in descending order.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è LIMIT 5

Limits the result set to only 5 rows.
