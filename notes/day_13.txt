50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-13

🔥Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show the patient_id and first_name from the patients table where the first_name starts and ends with the letter 's' and is at least 6 characters long and ordered by patient_id in ascending order.

💡Solution 

SELECT patient_id,first_name FROM 'patients' WHERE first_name LIKE 's____%s' ORDER BY patient_id ASC

📝 Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

▶️ SELECT patient_id,first_name 

This part of the SQL query specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the "patients" table. Therefore, this query will return a list of "patient_id" and "first_name" columns based on certain criteria.

▶️ FROM 'patients'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

▶️ WHERE first_name LIKE 's____%s' ORDER BY patient_id ASC

WHERE:- This is a filtering condition in the WHERE clause. It restricts the result set to only include rows where the 'first_name' column starts with 's,' followed by four characters, and ends with 's.' The underscore (_) is a wildcard representing a single character, and % is a wildcard representing zero or more characters.

ORDER BY:- This part of the query orders the result set based on the 'patient_id' column in ascending order (from the smallest to the largest).

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
