50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-22

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Your task is to count the number of invoices generated each year from the Invoice table.

üí°Solution 

SELECT strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) AS Year, COUNT(*) AS InvoiceCount FROM Invoice GROUP BY year

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as CustomerCount

This part of the query extracts the year from the InvoiceDate column and gives it an alias Year and counts the number of invoices for each year.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Invoice'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Invoice".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è GROUP BY Year

GROUP BY:- Groups the results by the extracted year.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
