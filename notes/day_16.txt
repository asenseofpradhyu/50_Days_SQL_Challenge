50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-16

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

write a SQL query to show all columns for a patient with a patient_id of 542 based on their most recent admission_date.

üí°Solution 

SELECT * FROM 'admissions' WHERE patient_id = 542 GROUP BY patient_id HAVING MAX(admission_date) 

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT *

This part of the SQL query will return all the column from 'admissions' table. the asterisk (*) shorthand notation that is used to select all columns from a specified table. It essentially means "select all."

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'admissions'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "admissions".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE patient_id = 542 GROUP BY patient_id HAVING MAX(admission_date)

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves data where the patient data of ID 542 and his most recent admission_date.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'patient_id = 542 GROUP BY patient_id HAVING MAX(admission_date)'.

GROUP BY:- This groups the rows in the table based on unique combinations of 'patient_id'.

MAX(admission_date): The expression MAX(admission_date) calculates the latest or maximum admission date for the patient with the ID 542 in the 'admissions' table.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
