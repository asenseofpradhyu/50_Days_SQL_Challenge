50 days SQL Challenge

Day-7

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve a list of names and countries of customers from the USA, ordering the results by the column 'FirstName' in ascending order

üí°Solution 

SELECT FirstName, Country FROM 'Customer' WHERE Country = 'USA' ORDER BY FirstName ASC

üìù Explanation


To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT FirstName, Country

This part of the SQL query specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the "Customer" table. Therefore, this query will return a list of "FirstName" and "Country" columns based on certain criteria.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Customer'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Customer.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE Country = 'USA' ORDER BY FirstName ASC

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves data where the 'country' is 'USA' and orders the results in ascending order based on the 'FirstName' column.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'Country = 'USA' ORDER BY FirstName ASC'.

ORDER BY:- Use this to sort the records in ascending or descending order. You can use 'ASC' for Ascending order and 'DESC' for Descending order.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
