50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-17

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

write an SQL query to find the difference between the largest and smallest weight among patients with the last name 'Maroni'.

üí°Solution 

SELECT MAX(weight) - MIN(weight) as weight_delta FROM 'patients' WHERE last_name = 'Maroni'

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT MAX(weight) - MIN(weight) as weight_delta

This part of the SQL query will calculates the weight difference (weight_delta) by subtracting the minimum weight from the maximum weight.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'patients'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE last_name = 'Maroni'

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves data where the patient last_name is 'Maroni'.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'last_name = 'Maroni''.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
