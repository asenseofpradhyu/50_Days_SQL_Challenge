50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-33

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show first name, last name, and the full province name of each patient

üí°Solution 

SELECT patients.first_name, patients.last_name, province_names.province_name AS province_name patients JOIN province_names ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT patients.first_name, patients.last_name: Selects the first name and last name from the "patients" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é province_names.full_name AS province_name: Selects the full province name from the "province_names" table and aliases it as "province_name."

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM patients: Specifies the "patients" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é JOIN province_names ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id: Performs a join between the "patients" and "province_names" tables based on the common "province_id" columns. This ensures that the province names are replaced with their complete names.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
