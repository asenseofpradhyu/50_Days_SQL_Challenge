50 days SQL Challenge

Day-5

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write a SQL query to show all columns for patients who have specific patient_ids: 1, 45, 534, 879, 1000.


üí°Solution 

SELECT * FROM patients WHERE patient_id IN (1, 45, 534, 879, 1000)

üìù Explanation

Here, The challenge is to retrieve all columns for patients who have specific patient_ids: 1, 45, 534, 879, 1000.

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT *

This part of the SQL query will return all the column from 'patients' table. the asterisk (*) shorthand notation that is used to select all columns from a specified table. It essentially means "select all."

NOTE:- It's generally a good practice to explicitly list the columns you need in your SELECT statement.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM patients

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "patients".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE patient_id IN (1, 45, 534, 879, 1000)

The IN operator in SQL is used to filter the result set based on a specified list of values. It allows you to write a more concise and readable query when you want to match a value against multiple possibilities.
This part of the SQL query filters records based on specific patient IDs is 1, 45, 534, 879, and 1000.


Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
