50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-9

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Fetch a list of all the unique cities in which the customers live. Results should be ordered alphabetically by the city name.

üí°Solution 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM 'Customer' ORDER BY City ASC

üìù Explanation


To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT DISTINCT CITY

This SQL query selects all unique values in the "City" column from the "Customer" table. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each city name appears only once in the result set.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'Customer'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "Customer".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ORDER BY City

ORDER BY:- Use this to sort the records in ascending or descending order. You can use 'ASC' for Ascending order and 'DESC' for Descending order.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
