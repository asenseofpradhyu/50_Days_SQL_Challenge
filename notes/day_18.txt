50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-18

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

write an SQL query to show the contact_name, address, and city from the customers and the query should only include customers that are NOT from the countries 'Germany', 'Mexico', or 'Spain'.

üí°Solution 

SELECT contact_name, address, city FROM 'customers' WHERE country NOT IN ('Germany', 'Mexico', 'Spain')

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT contact_name, address, city

This part tells the database to select the columns 'contact_name', 'address' and 'city' from the 'customers' table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'customers'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "customers".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE country NOT IN ('Germany', 'Mexico', 'Spain')

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves data from the 'country' column, excluding entries where the country is Germany, Mexico, or Spain.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'country NOT IN ('Germany', 'Mexico', 'Spain')'.

NOT IN:- The NOT IN operator is used to exclude rows where a specified column matches any value in a set. This query would return rows where the 'category' is not 'Germany' or 'Mexico' or 'Spain'.

BONUS:- The IN operator is used to include rows where a specified column matches any value in a set.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
