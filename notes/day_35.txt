50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-35

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Retrieve artists without any albums

üí°Solution 

SELECT Artist.Nam FROM Artist LEFT JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId WHERE Album.AlbumId IS NULL ORDER BY Artist.ArtistId

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT Artist.Name: Selects the artist names from the "Artist" table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é FROM Artist: Specifies the "Artist" table as the main table.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é LEFT JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId: Performs a left join between the "Artist" and "Album" tables based on the common "ArtistId" column.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é WHERE Album.AlbumId IS NULL: Filters the results to include only rows where there is no matching record in the "Album" table. This condition ensures that you are selecting artists who haven't released any albums.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é ORDER BY Artist.ArtistId: Orders the result set by "ArtistId" in ascending order

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
