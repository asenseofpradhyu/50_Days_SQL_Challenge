50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-45

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Show the city, company_name, contact_name from the customers and suppliers table merged together. Create a column named "relationship" which contains 'customers' or 'suppliers' depending on the table it came from

üí°Solution 

SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Patient' AS role FROM patients UNION ALL SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Doctor' AS role FROM doctors

üìù Explanation

To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT City, company_name, contact_name, 'customers' AS relationship: Retrieves the columns City, company_name, and contact_name from the customers table. It adds a new column relationship with the constant string value 'customers' for each row.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é UNION: Combines the results of the two SELECT statements. It ensures that duplicate rows are eliminated, and the result set only includes distinct rows.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Doctor' AS role: Retrieves the first_name and last_name columns from the doctors table. The literal string 'Doctor' is assigned as the role for each person in the doctors table.

The overall query creates a unified result set with columns for City, company_name, contact_name, and relationship. The relationship column indicates whether each row comes from the customers or suppliers table.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
