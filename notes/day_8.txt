50 Days SQL Challenge

Day-D

üî•Challenge 

The challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

Write a SQL query to show all the columns from the admissions table where the patient was admitted and discharged on the same day.

üí°Solution 

SELECT * FROM 'admissions' WHERE admission_date = discharge_date 

üìù Explanation


To solve this, let's break the SQL query into smaller queries.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è SELECT *

This part of the SQL query will return all the column from 'patients' table. the asterisk (*) shorthand notation that is used to select all columns from a specified table. It essentially means "select all."

‚ñ∂Ô∏è FROM 'admissions'

This part of the query indicates that you want to retrieve data from a table named "admissions".

‚ñ∂Ô∏è WHERE admission_date = discharge_date

This part of the query filters the data based on a specific condition: It retrieves data where the patient was admitted and discharged on the same day.

WHERE:- This is clause to filter rows based on specific condition. In our query the condition is 'admission_date = discharge_date'.

Let me know what you think! Please share your suggestions or feedback on how I can improve this SQL query or anything else.
